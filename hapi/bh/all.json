      "description": "The LANL 02A MPA data set contains numerical moments computed from measurements of the \nLos Alamos Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzer (MPA) [Bame et al., \nRev. Sci. Inst., in press 1993]. \nThe moments are presented in s/c coordinates: the z-axis is aligned with \nthe spin axis, which points radially toward the center of the Earth; \nthe x-axis is in the plane containing the spacecraft spin axis and the spin \naxis of the Earth, with +X generally northward; and the y-axis points \ngenerally eastward. Polar angles are measured relative to the spin axis \n(+Z), and azimuthal angles are measured around the z-axis, with zero along \nthe +X direction. The moments are computed for three 'species': \nlop (low-ener. ions, ~1eV/e-~130eV/e); hip (hi-ener. ions, ~130eV/e-~45keV/e);\n alle (electrons, ~30eV - ~45keV ). The electron measurements are obtained \n21.5 secs after the ion measurements. Epoch is the measurement time \nappropriate for the ions. The moments are computed after the fluxes are \ncorrected for background and s/c potential. Algorithms for these corrections\n are relatively unsophisticated, so the moments are suspect during times of \nhigh background and/or high spacecraft potential. Because the determined  \nspacecraft potential is not very precise, the magnitude of the low-energy \nion flow velocity is probably not accurate, but the flow direction is well \ndetermined.  Tperp and Tpara are obtained from diagonalization of the  \n3-dimensional temperature matrix, with the parallel direction assigned \nto the eigenvalue which is most different from the other two. \nThe corresponding eigenvector is the symmetry axis of the distribution and \nshould be equivalent to the magnetic field direction. The eigenvalue ratio \nTperp/Tmid, which is provided for each species, is a measure of the symmetry \nof the distribution and should be ~1.0 for a good determination. Several of  \nthe parameters have a fairly high daily dynamic range and for survey purposes \nare best displayed logarithmically. These parameters are indicated by  \nnon-zero 'SCALEMIN' values in this file. A quality flag value of 1  \nindicates that the values are suspect because of unreliable \nlocation info.",
